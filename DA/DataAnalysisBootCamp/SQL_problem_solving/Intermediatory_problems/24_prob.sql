-- A salesperson for Northwind is going on a business trip to visit
-- customers, and would like to see a list of all customers, sorted by
-- region, alphabetically.
-- However, he wants the customers with no region (null in the Region
-- field) to be at the end, instead of at the top, where youâ€™d normally find
-- the null values. Within the same region, companies should be sorted by
-- CustomerID

SELECT CustomerID, CompanyName, Region
FROM customers
ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN Region IS NULL THEN 1
        ELSE 0
    END,  -- This puts NULL values at the end
    Region ASC,  -- Then sort by Region alphabetically
    CustomerID ASC;  -- Finally, sort by CustomerID within each region



-- ALTERNATIVE 

SELECT CustomerID, CompanyName, Region
FROM customers
ORDER BY 
    Region IS NULL,  -- This puts NULL values at the end
    Region ASC,      -- Then sort by Region alphabetically
    CustomerID ASC;  -- Finally, sort by CustomerID within each region
